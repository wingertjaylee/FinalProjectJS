  <h2>How many teams are in the NHL?</h2>
  <p>There are currently 32 teams in the NHL. They are divided into two conferences, the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference.  Each conference is divided into two divisions; in the Eastern Conference it is divided into the Atlantic Division and the Metropolitan Division.  The Western Conference is divided into the Central Division and the Pacific Division.</p>

  <h2>What is the championship trophy in the NHL?</h2>
  <p>The Championship trophy is called the Stanley Cup.  It’s the oldest professional sports trophy in North America.  It was donated in 1892 by Lord Stanley of Preston, the Governor General of Canda.  The winning team’s roster is engraved on the outside of the cup.</p>

  <h2>How many players are on the ice at a time?</h2>
  <p>In a normal game there are 5 players that move about the ice rink and a goalie for a total of six players on the ice at a time.  However, if a player commits a penalty and is moved to the penalty box, then the opposing team gets a “power play”.  At that time, it becomes a 4 on 5 until the player’s penalty time is up and he can return to the ice.</p>

 <h2>What is the most common penalty in hockey?</h2>
 <p>The most common penalties are minor penalties.  These include hooking, holding, slashing, interference, and high sticking.  Offenders of minor penalties usually get two minutes in the penalty box.</p>

 <h2>What is icing?</h2>
 <p>Icing is a stoppage of play.  It happens when a player shoots the puck from their own side of the center red line, and it travels untouched to cross the opposing team’s goal line.  If icing is called a face-off restarts play at the offending team’s side of the rink in one of the circles.  Icing is not called during power plays.</p>

  <h2>What is a hat trick?</h2>
  <p>A hat trick is when a player scores three goals in a single game.  If a player scores four goals in a game it is called a “natural hat trick”.  If a player scores five goals in a game it is called a “double hat trick”.  When a player scores three goals in a game, fans will often throw their hats onto the ice to celebrate the achievement.</p>
