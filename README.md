This application is a hub for hockey fans to locate thier favorite team, find a game on the schedule, and for inidividuals new to the game there is also an FAQ.  My plan original was going to have the ability to click on the jersey to have a goal horn go off, along with a greeting depending upon the time of day.  It was also goingto have an interactive grid that woulsd allow a user to click on a team logo and see information such as statics.  Also when you clocked on the schdule the you would have two logos of the teams that would be facing off with vs. in between.  I was more ambitious than time allowed.  So this is a very simple application, wit hthe js. however I had trouble getting all the elemnts of the java script working.
